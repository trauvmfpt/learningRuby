This is the stuff I typed into a file.
It is really cool stuff.
Lots and lots of fun to have in here.
I'm sure about that, you dummy.


Commands to use when handling files:

   * close -- Closes the file. Like File->Save.. in your editor.
   * read -- Reads the contents of the file. You can assign the result to a variable.
   * readline -- Reads just one line of a text file.
   * truncate -- Empties the file. Watch out if you care about the file.
   * write('stuff') -- Writes "stuff" to the file.
   * seek(0) -- Move the read/write location to the beginning of the file.
